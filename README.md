# roguelike
A roguelike, written in Python

The primary goal of this project is to become more familiar with the github platform and with the Python programming language.  A secondary goal is to produce a game that I will enjoy playing and that I can share with others for their enjoyment.  Another secondary goal is to produce an example of my programming capabilities to show to potential employers.
